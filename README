This is a quick clone of a mobile game called "Stack!" created to demonstrate the
use of an early alpha build of the SimpleSceneGraph library.

Dependencies:
	1) libsdl2-dev  2.0.2
	2) libsdl2-image-dev  2.0.0
	3) libsdl2-ttf-dev   2.0.12

The pre-alpha build of SimpleSceneGraph is included in this repository.

To build, run:
	make build

The built game, including necessary assets, will be inside build/rectstack/
